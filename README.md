# auto_workflow
Creating a workflow for aiida that runs automatically

SMILES with attachement points are combined together and .com Input files, .sh SLURM files are created.
The SLURM files are then submited to HPC

Naming Convention:

- Torsional scan neutral → tor
- Optimisation neutral/Population analysis → pop_opt_n
- Vertical anion → ver_a
- Vertical cation → ver_c
- Optimisation anion → opt_a
- Optimisation cation → opt_c
